### Learnings from the project

- Browser SpeechSyntesis API used from the library **react-speech-kit**
- **Custom React Hooks** from the Timer API used from the library **react-timer-hook**
- [Nested forms](https://github.com/venky4c/web-speech-timer/blob/master/dist/src/App.js) declared inside another function based component, used to take user inputs
- React useEffect hook used along with useCallback to declare the dependency array parameters so that there are no warnings at runtime.
